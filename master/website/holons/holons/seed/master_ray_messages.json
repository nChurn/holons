You&rsquo;ll report directly to our Provider Recruitment Lead and will work closely with her to refine and execute our sales funnel, create best-in-class customer service support, and build strong relationships with mental health providers. From day one, you&rsquo;ll get exposure to what it&rsquo;s like to build a business from the ground-up and you&rsquo;ll be able to drive real impact.<br /><br />\nWhat You&rsquo;ll Do: <br /><br />\nYour responsibilities will evolve over time as we scale. You will own the end-to-end sales relationship with providers across the country who reach out to us, from initial interest in Grow to providing support through onboarding to signing. <br /><br />\nResponsibilities include:<br />\nBuild partnerships with ~20 new providers a week via Zoom, each relationship tailored based on the providers&rsquo; license type, stage in private practice, and location <br />\nProvide strategic business consultancy to guide providers opening a private practice and help the Grow team evolve; requires deep understanding of Grow&rsquo;s business <br />\nProvide excellent customer service through continuous email support throughout the onboarding journey; cultivate strong relationships with providers <br />\nCollaborate closely with Grow&rsquo;s recruitment team to refine our partnership pitch and optimize support efforts<br /><br />\nWho You Are:<br /><br />\nPeople-Person: Connecting with new people, building stellar relationships, and pitching gives you energy.

Most independent providers won&rsquo;t accept insurance because of the significant administrative burden. Meanwhile, patients are struggling to find quality care that is both affordable and convenient. With rates of anxiety and depression up 250% since March 2020, this problem is more relevant than ever.<br /><br />\nGrow is on a mission to make quality mental healthcare accessible and affordable across the country. We do this two-fold: first by dramatically simplifying the process for independent providers to launch insurance-accepting practices; second by enabling patients to more effectively find an in-network dedicated practitioner.<br /><br />\nSince launching in July 2020, Grow has already received backing from top VCs and angel investors, including leaders of Village Global, Airbnb, Nurx, PatientPing, Wellframe and Blackstone. Our founding team comes from Harvard Medical School, Google, Stripe, and Blackstone, and we&rsquo;re excited to expand the team and continue onboarding providers from our 200+ (and growing!) waitlist. We&rsquo;re in our hyper growth stage and expanding to various states to improve mental health care accessibility throughout the country.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $25.00-$30.00\n\n<br /><b>Posted On</b>: July 15, 2021 17:48 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Sales &amp; Business Development<br /><b>Skills</b>:Relationship Management,     Business Planning &amp; Strategy,     Partnership Development,     HubSpot,     B2C,     Healthcare &amp; Medical,     Small (10-99 employees),     Sales,     Customer Service,     Email Handling,     Customer Support,     Interpersonal Skills,     Communication,     Sales Process,     Answering Product Questions,     Call Handling,     Outbound Sales,     Consultation,     Customer Acqusition    \n<br /><b>Country</b>: United States\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Sales-Associate-Mental-Health-Startup-provide-biz-consulting-amp-customer-support-therapists_%7E019a121406380b57db?source=rss\">click to apply</a>",
